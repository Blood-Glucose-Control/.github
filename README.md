Improving short-term prandial blood glucose outcomes for people with T1D, a complex disease that affects ~10 million people worldwide. We use a variety of AI/ML techniques to assist T1D with diabetes management: things like change point detection, probabilistic forecasting, RL insulin pumps, and causal machine-learning techniques!
